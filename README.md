## General Info

The Labyrinth Game is a task by AMAKids built with ReactJS + Redux.
At the beginning the player get a random point, then he have to track generated route in his mind and choose the end point of the path.
Game has only one set of settings so far, such as Field size (3x3), amount of steps (10), speed of generating each step (800ms). If i had more time i would add the possibility to choose the difficulty level before starting the game.
Also in the future i plan to create more games.
